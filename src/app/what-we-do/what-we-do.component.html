          Every organisation implements their own unique approach(es) to ensure a product’s success.
           There are various Food & Beverage organisations who are very good at adopting spearhead approach, however, with the best of the intentions they cannot add an additional prong due to various reasons e.g., contract manufacturing, costs involved in setting-up an efficient innovation team, unavailability of infrastructure, etc. Spearhead approach can be defined loosely as all actions taken ex-factory e.g., Aggressive marketing campaigns, establishing efficient supply-chain, sales and customer support teams etc. However, an addition prong can be added to Spearhead approach which is internal to the organisation e.g., establishing efficient innovation & quality teams, making efficient production processes etc. An additional prong to spearhead will give confidence and additional stability on product landing. We, Foirfe Process and Product solutions, can be an additional prong to your spearhead and ensure your product can be produced efficiently and meet customer product requirements.

          Food & beverage products and their ingredients are dynamic systems; molecular reactions within them never cease to happen. Due to the dynamic nature of Food & beverage products, their manufacturing is very different from the manufacturing of machines or any other inert products. During the manufacture of Food & Beverages external factors (Temperature, humidity, air quality etc), internal factors (composition, ingredient interactions, age, pH etc) and  processing conditions (heat treatment, pressure, filtration, blending, carbonation, filling etc)  will have significant impact on the final product functionality & quality. Foirfe Product and Process solutions have experience in identifying/addressing processing effects on ingredient interactions and subsequent quality and functionality of finished products. Please contact us to discuss how we can work together to minimise reworks, product wastage and improve production “hit rate”.
